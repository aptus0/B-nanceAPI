Real-Time Trading with Technical Indicators Using WebSocket and Binance API

Introduction:
This project aims to develop a real-time trading system using Python, WebSocket, and the Binance API. The system utilizes various technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average (MA), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to generate trading signals for cryptocurrency pairs traded on the Binance exchange.

Features:

WebSocket Integration: Utilizes WebSocket to establish a real-time connection with the Binance exchange, allowing for the streaming of live price data for selected cryptocurrency pairs.
Technical Indicator Calculation: Implements algorithms for calculating key technical indicators such as RSI, MA, and MACD based on incoming price data.
Trading Signal Generation: Analyzes the calculated indicators to generate trading signals, indicating potential buy or sell opportunities.
User Interaction: Allows users to specify the cryptocurrency pair they want to trade and the amount they wish to invest in US dollars.
Profit Potential Assessment: Evaluates the potential profit percentage based on the difference between the current price and the price at which the trading signal is generated.
How It Works:

The system establishes a WebSocket connection with the Binance exchange to receive real-time price updates for the specified cryptocurrency pair.
It calculates key technical indicators such as RSI, MA, and MACD based on the received price data.
Using the calculated indicators, the system generates trading signals indicating potential buy or sell opportunities.
Users input the cryptocurrency pair they want to trade and the amount they wish to invest in US dollars.
The system evaluates the profit potential by comparing the current price with the price at which the trading signal is generated and presents this information to the user.
Benefits:

Real-Time Analysis: Provides traders with real-time insights into market movements and potential trading opportunities.
Automated Trading Signals: Automates the process of generating trading signals based on predefined technical indicators, reducing manual effort and decision-making time.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a simple and interactive interface for users to specify their trading preferences and assess profit potential.
Conclusion:
By combining WebSocket technology, the Binance API, and advanced technical analysis techniques, this project enables traders to make informed decisions and potentially capitalize on market movements in real-time. It provides a valuable tool for both novice and experienced traders seeking to optimize their cryptocurrency trading strategies.
